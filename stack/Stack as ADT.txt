Stack is a non-primitive data structure.
It is an ordered list in which insertion and deletion of items occur from one end also known as the Top end.
The "LAST ADDED ELEMENT IS THE FIRST TO BE REMOVED OUT). Thus Stack is also know as "LAST IN FISRT OUT"[LIFO].


Operations :
	1)push(x): adds a new element x to the top of the stack.
	2)pop(): removes and returns the element from the top of the stack.
	3)peek(): returns the topmost element from the stack without removing it.
